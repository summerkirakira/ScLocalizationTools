I need someone to breach their ship, get a hold of their decryption key, and decrypt the server so I can remotely pull down what I need.\n\nYou're smart enough to know who we're dealing with here, so plan accordingly.

+ RedWind_Delivery_Illegal_Desc_Intro=RED WIND LINEHAUL\n'YOUR GOODS IN GOOD HANDS'\n----------------------------\n\nI know you've done some solid work for us in the past, so I figured I'd see if you were interested in handling a bit of a special run for us that's a bit farther out in the system than what you've been doing so far.\n\nIn a nutshell, we need a pilot who's willing to keep their head down, focus on getting the packages delivered, and most importantly, not ask a lot of questions.\n\nSee, for a smaller company like us, staying ahead of competition means that we need to offer our clients something they can't get elsewhere - discretion. At Red Wind, as long as you got the credits we'll take whatever to wherever. Understand?\n\nIf that sounds good to you, let's see how you do on this run -\n\nPACKAGES FOR PICK UP (ANY ORDER)\n     · Package #~mission(item1|serialnumber) from ~mission(Pickup1|Address)\n     · Package #~mission(item2|serialnumber) from ~mission(Pickup2|Address)\n     · Package #~mission(item3|serialnumber) from ~mission(Pickup3|Address)\n\nDROP OFF LOCATIONS (ANY ORDER)\n     · Package #~mission(item1|serialnumber) to ~mission(Dropoff1|Address)\n     · Package #~mission(item2|serialnumber) to ~mission(Dropoff2|Address)\n     · Package #~mission(item3|serialnumber) to ~mission(Dropoff3|Address)\n\nOne last bit of advice, it would probably be good to avoid any unnecessary delays once you got the packages onboard, for example being searched by local law enforcement. \n

The gravity generator's going to need a complete overhaul to get it working again, and that means we need to park up in a garage for a few days. \n\nSince I know we’re not going to do that until this job's done, and there’s a good chance the gravity's going to keep fritzing out on us which is less than ideal, so in the meanwhile, I went ahead and rigged the engineering console to allow anybody to do a hard reset of the system if they need to.\n\nFigure at least this way if I'm gunked up patching another part of the ship you all don't have to wait for me.\n\n-Judy\n

Client paid out serious creds, so I can't just let it drift.\n\nWant you to get aboard the October Rising, get my shit, and get out. \n\nWord is that security are still on site so you might wanna pull together a crew if you got 'em. If you're feeling really highline, shut down the nearest comm array to cover your tracks. Point is, they probably won't react well to you showing up, but just remember they aren't the priority.\n\nDrop the package off at the clinic on Grim HEX and we'll transfer the creds.

Now that an area I generally like to steer well clear of, but a gig’s a gig, right? It seems that one of their mobile butcher shops aboard the 'October Rising' got pinched by private security while out chopping. Now the Nine Tails are willing to cut ties with the ship and its crew (who are probably all dead anyway), but they need a particular crate extracted. Guess it was a special order or something.\n\nAnyway, get aboard the October Rising, get the package, and get out.\n\nSecurity’s still hanging around so watch yourself and maybe bring some friends, but remember, your priority is the package. If you're looking to save yourself some extra hassle, you could also black out the area by shutting down the nearest comm array if you want to avoid the crimestats for, you know, killing a bunch of a security.
